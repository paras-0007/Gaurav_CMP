i have attached the python code file and the html file code that is scraped in the python code , so your task is to first observed all the things deeply and your task is to do with the code the following changes that are : 
- keep in mind you can change anything in the code either to add or remove in the code 
- we have to scrap this html file as you can see , we have to generate the final csv file as a result which contains various columns like - case number , case title , case description and then we will see there is email section which caontains many columns also like emails name , status , subject , fromaddress , message date , and at last case summary ,then the following content in the page 
*** now we have some conditions applied for the scraping part or generating the csv report that are as follows :
- first you go through the webpage which's html code i have attached 
- every column must include their content respectively which is required for the column itself. 
- mainly after the emails section , you can see there are many tables which contains email name and content etc in it and in the same page the whole table is repeated again and again 2 or 3 times , so we have to avoid the duplicacy i.e once the table and its content scraped it must not be incuded in the final results again 
- keep the csv file very much structured and try to make it pass the content of each column to itself 

important note: - keep in mind you can make any changes in the python code and try to keep it in optimising either you have to add or remove code from your own knowledge base 
- try to avoid the overfitting of content in any column
